# Lispinto Chat

A chat app that connects to a [https://github.com/ryukinix/lisp-chat](lisp-chat) server.

## Support

This project is intended to work on these platforms:

- macOS (desktop)
- iOS (mobile)
- Android (mobile)
- Web (browser or PWA)

I did not test it on all the aforementioned, so if you find any issue, please report it.

## How to use

### Web client (published)

This client is published as a web app at https://labs.mateusfccp.me/lispinto-chat/.

### macOS and Android

You can download the latest version from the [releases](https://github.com/ryukinix/lispinto-chat/releases) page.

## Other clients

You may clone this repository and run it locally or compile it yourself. Although it was not tested, it should work on
Windows and Linux (desktop).

I did test it on iOS (Simulator), but I did not publish it on the App Store, so you will need to compile it yourself if
you want to run it on an iOS device. Maybe I will publish the IPA file in the release page in the future, but I don't
have plans to publish it on the App Store because of rea$ons.
